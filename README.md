## ðŸ¥¤Gulp Boilerplate

A basic Gulp boilerplate to get developing locally with a few helpful tools already set up.

Tasks included:

- Sass minify
- JS minify
- Image minify
- Live reload

## How to run
Install Gulp globally (if you don't already have it).

    npm install gulp-cli -g
Install necessary packages

    npm install
Run Gulp.

    gulp

The live reload task should then initiate the project on http://localhost:3000. If that port is already taken it will default to another number such as localhost:3001.
